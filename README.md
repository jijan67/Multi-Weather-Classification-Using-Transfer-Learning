# Multi-Weather-Classification-Using-Transfer-Learning
Weather classification model achieves 92% accuracy across 7 classes using VGG19 transfer learning with logistic regression. High performance metrics: Cloudy (0.93), Fog (0.83), Rain (0.99), Sand (0.88), Shine (0.93), Snow (0.93), and Sunrise (0.96) f1-scores. The model effectively distinguishes between diverse weather conditions.
